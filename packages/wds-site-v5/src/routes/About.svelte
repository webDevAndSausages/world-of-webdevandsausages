			Web Dev & Sausages is a completely volunteer event which exists thanks to sponsors. Since it
			began in 2016, it has attracted large, enthusiastic groups of developers from Tampere and
			beyond. Events fill up within a few hours of being announced. Sponsors contribute not only
			money and spaces, but also their culture and ideas. Our goal is to join with sponsors to keep
			the events high quality and exciting. Sponsoring companies benefit in a number of ways:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc p-4">
			<li>Company visibility among a large group of talented developers</li>
			<li>A presentation about the company, where you can also recruit</li>
			<li>At least one developer from the company is invited to speak</li>
			<li>WD&S sponsors our proudly listed as supporters on our website for eternity</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please get in touch with

			Web Dev & Sausages loves its speakers, and we take pride in the wide variety of people who
			speak--developers, architects, designers, managers, and artists. Topics can range from
			languages and tools, to making music and even mental strategies. We like to embrace the full
			scope of developing for the web. So you belong too!

			<dt>- Is x topic ok?</dt>
			<dd>
				The most important thing is that the topic interests you. We are happy to give feedback if
				you would like to suggest an idea.
			</dd>
			<dt>- How long should the presentation be?</dt>
			<dd>20 minutes is a good target. Over 30 is too long.</dd>
			<dt>- Does it have to involve code/coding?</dt>
			<dd>absolutely not</dd>
			<dt>- Do I have to be filmed?</dt>
			<dd>
				No, it is just fine if you prefer not to be. Sometimes it is better to be on the safe side
				if the talk touches on a customer project.
			</dd>
			<dt>- Do I get a cool prize for this?</dt>
			<dd>Yep, you do. Check out our swag link below.</dd>
